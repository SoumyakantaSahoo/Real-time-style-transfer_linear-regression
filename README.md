Simple linear regression is a statistical method that allows us to summarize and study relationships between two continuous (quantitative) variables.
One variable, denoted , is regarded as the predictor, explanatory, or independent variable.
The other variable, denoted , is regarded as the response, outcome, or dependent variable.

In Linear Regression, it is assumed that the two variables have a linear relationship (hence the name). The object of this method is to find a linear function, that predicts the response value for a particular feature value as accurately as possible.

If the various points are plotted on a scatter plot, the problem of Linear Regression basically asks us: what is the line that best fits the above scatter plot, by minimising the inaccuraccy.
